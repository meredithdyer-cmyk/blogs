            <h2>Why do I write stories?</h2>
            <p>I have been into the art of storytelling ever since I was only two years
                old. When I was making my own lore within my sloppily-drawn circles. Throughout my childhood it evolved from scenarios in my head into what many people accliam to be 'emotional masterpieces.'
                And have been made into highly acclaimed movies and tv series. But I'm not just here for the fame. I'm here to inspire people. 
            People who feel like they belong. People who don't feel like they belong. I'm here for those who just feel in love. And those who 
        need a nice break-up story. I write for betrayers and those who have been betrayed. I write for the inspiration for others who need it. </p>
